# What is Character Encoding?

**Character encoding** is a system that pairs each character in a set (such as letters, numbers, and symbols) with a specific code that computers can understand and process. It enables the representation and manipulation of text in digital systems.

### Common Character Encodings:

1. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**: Represents English characters using 7-bit binary codes.
2. **UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit)**: A widely used encoding that supports all Unicode characters and is backward compatible with ASCII.
3. **UTF-16**: Uses 16-bit units to encode characters, suitable for languages with large character sets.
4. **ISO-8859**: A family of encodings for various languages, often used in legacy systems.

### Why is Character Encoding Important?

- Ensures text is displayed correctly across different systems and platforms.
- Prevents data corruption when transferring text between systems.
- Supports multilingual text and special characters.

Understanding character encoding is essential for working with text data in programming, web development, and data processing.

# Logic Gates Explained

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. They perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. Below are the common types of logic gates, their symbols, truth tables, and functionality.

## 1. AND Gate

- **Function**: Outputs `1` only if all inputs are `1`.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

## 2. OR Gate

- **Function**: Outputs `1` if at least one input is `1`.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

---

## 3. NOT Gate

- **Function**: Inverts the input (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
- **Truth Table**:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | 1      |
| 1     | 0      |

---

## 4. NAND Gate

- **Function**: Outputs `0` only if all inputs are `1` (NOT of AND gate).
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

## 5. NOR Gate

- **Function**: Outputs `1` only if all inputs are `0` (NOT of OR gate).
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 0      |

Logic gates are fundamental in designing digital circuits, including processors, memory, and other computing systems.

# What is Binary?

**Binary** is a number system that uses only two digits, `0` and `1`. It is the foundation of all modern computing systems because digital devices operate using two states: on (1) and off (0).

### Key Features of Binary:

1. **Base-2 System**: Unlike the decimal system (base-10), binary is a base-2 system.
2. **Representation of Data**: All types of data in computers, such as text, images, and audio, are represented in binary.
3. **Logical Operations**: Binary is used in logic gates and circuits to perform computations.

### Binary to Decimal Conversion:

To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each binary digit by 2 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 on the right) and sum the results.

**Example**: Binary `1011` to Decimal  
`(1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11`

### Why is Binary Important?

- **Efficiency**: Binary simplifies the design of electronic circuits.
- **Reliability**: Digital systems using binary are less prone to errors caused by noise.
- **Universality**: Binary is the universal language of computers.

Understanding binary is essential for working with computer systems, programming, and digital electronics.
